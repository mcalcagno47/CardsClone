# Cards Against Apathy

## Description

Cards Against Apathy is a brand new exercise app meant to bring fun and surprise into your workouts.  Created for users with a sense of adventure and spontaneity, this app gamifies the workout experience, randomizing the exercises the user will be performing using a deck of cards.  Should the user like the workout they performed, they can save the series of activities into their personalized favorites section, where they will be able to find it whenever they'd like.

This project was constructed by four people who wanted to either focus on working out more, or excite their experience at home while staying healthy.  After sitting for hours on the computer for work and school, getting up, out and moving was extremely important to them, and this app set out to create what they were looking for.  It respects the user's time by performing the workout research for them, allowing for a quicker, playful excercise regimen.

## Installation

The project runs in the browser, and does not require an installation.


## Usage

When the user opens the website, they will be prompted to select a suit, which corresponds to a type of exercise, and the number of cards that will be drawn (the number of exercises that will be performed).  When both of these selections have been made, the set amount of cards will appear, faced down.  When the user clicks on the cards, they will flip over, revealing the card, exercise, and a button that provides a description of the workout if clicked.  Once the exercise is completed, the card can be clicked again to gray it out, marking it as completed.  Upon completion of the workout, a modal appears, congratulating the user and providing two options: either going back, thus refreshing the page, or saving the workout as a favorite.  Should they choose to save a favorite workout, they will need to name it and hit save.  It will be saved in local storage whenever the user decides to return to it.

## Future Development

We hope to return to this project one day to add community features, allowing users to share completed and favorite workouts with friends for some friendly competition.  Providing the option for users to select whether they have weights available and creating a different set of options for suits to choose from would be an appealing additional feature for many who would like to use the app otherwise. Also, adding icons to the cards to supplement the long texts would also be a nice addition, however, that would mean migrating to a different workout API.
